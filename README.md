# PragmaticContext

PragmaticContext lets declaratively contextualize your
ActiveModel objects in terms of Linked Data concepts, giving you an easy way to
get your models talking JSON-LD.

## What's JSON-LD?

I'm glad you asked. [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) is a lightweight JSON format
for expressing data within a context (also known as 'Linked Data'). Essentially
what this means is that it lets you say that the thing your data model calls
a 'last_name' (and what someone else may call 'family_name', or 'surname', or 'apellido') are all embodiments of the same abstract idea of a [Family
Name](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_familyName). JSON-LD is similar in spirit
(though [vastly different in
execution](http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/)) to
[RDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). It allows
users of your application to unambiguously establish the place of your application's data
within a larger universe by placing it in context.

If you're just getting started with JSON-LD, I highly recommend the [JSON-LD 1.0 W3C
Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) (really. Start at section 5).
It's a straightforward description of JSON-LD's purpose and structure, and
should be an easy read for anyone who already uses JSON. I wish more standards
documents were written this way. Seriously, it's great.

## An example

As an example, let's consider the following Mongoid document:

    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document

      field :first_name
      field :last_name
      field :email
    end

As implemented above, a Person object has a first name, a last name, an email
address, and would serialize to JSON as something like:

    { 
      "first_name": "Mat",
      "last_name": "Trudel",
      "email": "mat@geeky.net"
    }

While that's usually clear enough to a human interacting with your API, the
field names chosen are basically arbitrary, and are difficult to process in any
automated way. Ideally, your field names should be able to unambiguously
identify a field as representing the concept of a person's first
name, whether the field was named 'first_name', 'FirstName', 'given_name', or
even 'field1234'. By allowing you to contextualize your data, JSON-LD lets you
essentially say "when I say 'last_name', I really mean
`http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/familyName`". In so doing, it becomes possible to
associate the last name fields of any JSON-LD API, regardless of what they name
their fields.

## Isn't this just a re-invention of RDF?

Yes and no. While it's true that JSON-LD is a valid RDF serialization format,
this [wasn't one of its original design
goals](http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/). My intent with
PragmaticContext is to allow developers who already work with JSON data to be
able to easily turn it into Linked Data without having to know or care about RDF
at all. At a basic level, the concepts of Linked Data should be grokkable by
anyone who already understands the basic concepts of APIs in general. JSON-LD's
creator Manu Sporny says it best:

> I’ve heard many people say that JSON-LD is primarily about the Semantic Web,
> but I disagree, it’s not about that at all. JSON-LD was created for Web
> Developers that are working with data that is important to other people and
> must interoperate across the Web. The Semantic Web was near the bottom of my
> list of “things to care about” when working on JSON-LD, and anyone that tells
> you otherwise is wrong

In terms of my personal approach to developing PragmanticContext, I'm
consciously not considering RDF as entering into the equation at all. With
PragmaticContext, I'm playing the role of an API developer already steeped in
JSON who wants to make their data more expressive without having to slow down
or learn a new stack. While I personally understand RDF's role and potential,
I'm willfully ignoring it with the goal of producing a library relevant to JSON
API developers. My thesis is that if JSON-LD is to be relevant to existing JSON
API developers, it needs to do so as a natural outgrowth of their existing
environment.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pragmatic_context'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pragmatic_context

## Usage

PragmaticContext is implemented as a module that you mix into your existing
ActiveModel objects. Taking the `Person` model above, you would add context to
it like so:

    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      include PragmaticContext::Contextualizable

      field :first_name
      field :last_name
      field :email

      contextualize :first_name, :as => 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName'
      contextualize :last_name, :as => 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/familyName'
      contextualize :email, :as => 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/mbox'
    end

The `Contextualizable` mixin adds a `context` method to the Person object which
returns a Hash object ready to be serialized into the output object. By wiring
this up in whatever serializer your application uses, you would end up with
the following JSON(-LD!) serialization:


    { 
      "@context": {
        "first_name": { "@id", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName" },
        "last_name": { "@id", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/familyName" },
        "email": { "@id", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/mbox" },
      },
      "first_name": "Mat",
      "last_name": "Trudel",
      "email": "mat@geeky.net"
    }

### Dynamic documents & more complicated cases

There are cases (especially using Monogid's dynamic fields feature) where the
list of an object's fields is not known at class load time. In these cases, it's
possible to defer contextualization to a custom `Contextualizer` class
configured like so:

    class Person
      include Mongoid::Document
      include PragmaticContext::Contextualizable

      #
      # Machinery for defining fields, either static or dynamic
      #

      contextualize_with CustomContextualizer
    end

    class CustomContextualizer
      def definitions_for_terms(terms)
        # Returns a hash of terms => term definitions
      end
    end

Examples of this are forthcoming.

## Known Issues

* `@type` values aren't yet handled in any real way. This is next up on my queue
  and should be done very soon.
* The above example is purposely short on serialization specifics. I'm trying to
  be accommodating of various serializers and I'm still figuring out the best
  way to do this. Hopefully we'll be able to make the process of adding
  a `@context` automatic (or close to it) for common cases. Suggestions for this
  point are very welcome.
* Further to the above, there are many (most, even) use cases where the included
  `@context` field should simply be a URI pointing to a stand-alone
  represntation of the object's context. I'm not sure how to flexibly realize
  this yet. Again, suggestions are very welcome.
